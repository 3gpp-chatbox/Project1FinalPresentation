Considering the outcomes of Phase 1, along with the key requirements outlined in the project proposal and received suggestions, we will primarily focus on the following tasks in the next phases:
R1:Comprehensive Procedural Model Extraction
Existing methods extract only limited procedural models, following a predefined route.
Enhance extraction to model all possible procedure variations across different state combinations and conditions.
R2: Flow Property Graph Visualization
Implement syntax highlighting for improved readability.
R4: Interactive Graph Updates
Enable experts to modify and refine generated models directly in a web browser.
R5: Summarized Insights
Provide concise summaries of the extracted procedures.
